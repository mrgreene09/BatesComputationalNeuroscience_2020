    "Reverse correlation is a technique for studying how sensory neurons respond to various stimuli, in order to understand the relationship between stimulus and neural response. Many neurons are driven by sensory stimulation from the outside world and is in a baseline state in the absence of that stimulation. When presented with an appropriate stimulus, the neuron is either activated above its baseline state of activity or in some cases suppressed below it's baseline. The degree of activation is captured in the neuron's firing rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within the file, $rho$ is a boolean vector indicating spike times (1 = spike, 0 = no spike), and $stim$ indicates the intensity of the stimulus (in this case, the horizontal speed of moving dots).\n",

Why are they called H1 neurons? Because they detect movement in the horizontal direction! We're going to prove this in the first problem!\n",
