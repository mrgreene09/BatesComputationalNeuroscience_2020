They recorded the neuron at 500 Hz (in other words, each sample represents 2 ms). Within the file, $rho$ is a boolean vector where 1 denotes a spike and $stim$ is a variable indicating the intensity of the visual stimulus (in this case, the angular velocity of the random moving dots). We will only be using the rho vector today, but we will return to this data set next week.\n",

Calculate the ISI distribution for this dataset, and use the code below to plot the histogram of ISIs. Hint: [**np.where()**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html) will be helpful to get these indices.
