    "The goal of today's notebook is to give you practice modifying predicted firing rates according to two popular models of nonlinearity: the rectified linear, and the sigmoid. Both types of nonlinearity aim to make more accurate model neurons by allowing for threshold values (both), and saturation (sigmoid).\n",

    "Let's start out by creating a simulated predicted firing rate. In real life, we would do this by convolving the spike-triggered average (STA) with the stimulus, but here we will create a random function using **np.random.randn()**. This function outputs numbers drawn from a standard normal distribution (mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1).\n",
