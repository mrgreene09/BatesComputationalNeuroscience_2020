    "The spike-triggered average is defined as the *average stimulus before each spike*.\n",

    "Let's first begin by creating a white noise stimulus. Recall that this is a random stimulus that is drawn from a normal distribution. Create an experiment that is 5 seconds long, and sampled at 1000 Hz. Use [np.random.randn()](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.randn.html) to define the stimulus. Plot your stimulus versus time."

    "Great! Now, we need to create our model neuron. Although we could do something fancy like use a Hodgkin and Huxley or integrate and fire neuron here, we are going to keep things simple. Here, our model neuron will respond with a 1 (i.e. a spike) each time the stimulus goes above 2, and will respond 0 in all other cases. Because real neurons cannot respond instantly, place your spike 100 ms after the stimulus goes above 2. (Note: you will not be able to do this for times within 100 ms of the end of the experiment)."

As before, your model neuron will fire if the stimulus goes above 2. However, this time, use **np.random.randint()** to choose a random time 50-150 ms after the stimulus peak to place your spike.
