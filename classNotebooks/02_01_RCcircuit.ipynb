    "The first model neuron we will consider is the leaky integrate and fire model. It is based on the simple resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit that you will learn about here, with an extra rule: the model neuron spikes whenever the membrane potential surpasses a threshold. It is a simple and useful model, but ignores the detailed biophysical mechanisms behind spiking. We will get to this in the Hodgkin and Huxley model.\n",

    "$$V_{rest} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{p_{Na+}[Na+]_o + p_{K+}[K+]_o + p_{Cl-}[Cl-]_i}{p_{Na+}[Na+]_i + p_{K+}[K+]_i + p_{Cl-}[Cl-]_o} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the GHK equation gets you a voltage at which **net flow** is 0, but individual ion flows can be non-zero. This means that ions will be flowing into or out of the cell, abolishing the very concentration gradients that set up the voltage difference in the first place! Because of this, cells have to expend energy to keep up their concentration gradients. The primary protein in this system is the **sodium-potassium pump**, which cleaves ATP in order to push sodium and potassium against their gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "These constant flows are the reason why the ion channels underlying the resting membrane potential are often called \"leak\" channels.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Concentration gradients are batteries because the separation of ions enables *work*.  \n",
    "- The membrane is a resistor because it allows some ions to flow depending on their *permeability*.  \n",
    "- Conductance, termed *g* because we ran out of letters, is the inverse of resistance $g = 1/R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this frame of reference, the GHK equation can be re-written as:\n",
